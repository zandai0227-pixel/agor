# Agor

**Team command center for all things agentic.**

Agor is a self-hosted, multiplayer-ready web workspace for running coding agents — Claude Code,
Codex, Gemini, and others — on isolated git branches. Each branch is a first-class git working
directory with its own dev environment and conversation history. Agents run in the browser instead
of a terminal, with per-prompt token and cost accounting, structured tool output, and an MCP
endpoint agents can drive themselves. Run it solo in a few minutes; turn on multiplayer and
Unix-level isolation when you bring your team.

## Built on the agent CLIs & SDKs you already use

Agor ships no model of its own. It drives the coding-agent CLIs and SDKs you already run,
interchangeable per session — bring your own provider and subscription, no vendor lock-in.

## What it does

- **Branches as the anchor** — every piece of work is a git branch with its own working directory,
  dev environment, conversation history, and PR. One entity to point at.
- **Isolated dev environments** — a one-click dev server per branch, with ports auto-assigned so
  parallel branches never collide.
- **Multi-runtime** — Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, OpenCode, Copilot, and Cursor (beta) are
  interchangeable per session. Bring your own provider; no vendor lock-in.
- **Rich session UI** — per-prompt token and dollar accounting, structured tool blocks,
  model/effort selectors, completion chimes. The terminal experience, in the browser.
- **MCP-native** — Agor exposes itself over MCP; sessions are auto-issued a token, so agents fork,
  spawn, schedule, and report on their own work.
- **Long-lived AI teammates** — persistent coworkers, each with a Knowledge-base namespace for
  durable, searchable memory, plus skills and schedules. They collaborate with the team and with
  each other, beyond one-off sessions.
- **Multiplayer when you want it** — live cursors, comments, and shared sessions/environments for
  your team. Optional; works fine solo.
- **Governance & observability** — branch-scoped RBAC and ACLs, per-user credentials and env
  vars, and per-prompt token + dollar accounting with full, durable history across every session.
- **Self-hosted, with explicit isolation** — your repos and database (LibSQL or Postgres), with
  trusted local, fail-closed sandbox, or delegated external execution. BSL 1.1.

---

## Quick Start

Requires **Node.js ≥ 22.12** ([install](https://nodejs.org)) and **Git** on `PATH`. HTTPS remotes also require a working system CA trust store; SSH remotes require an SSH client and configured keys or agent access.

```bash
npm install -g agor-live

agor init           # creates config/database and installs the tools you select
agor daemon start   # runs the daemon in the background
agor open           # opens the web UI
```

Use `agor install` later to change or repair the selected agentic tools; it does not initialize or recreate Agor.

That's it — add a repo and create your first session from the onboarding wizard.

Prefer Homebrew? See the [Getting Started guide](https://agor.live/guide/getting-started) for the
brew path. For Docker, source builds, Postgres, and team setups, see
[Extended Installation](https://agor.live/guide/extended-install).

## Core Concepts

Agor is built on three foundational entities — everything else builds on these:

- **[Branches](https://agor.live/guide/branches)** — the unit of work. A first-class git working
  directory on its own branch, with an isolated dev environment and its own conversations.
  Conventionally 1 branch = 1 feature/PR.
- **[Sessions & Trees](https://agor.live/guide/sessions)** — agent conversations with genealogy.
  **Fork** to explore alternatives (copies context), **spawn** subsessions for focused subtasks
  (fresh context window).
- **[Boards & Zones](https://agor.live/guide/boards)** — a Figma-like 2D canvas of branches. Drop
  a branch into a zone to fire a templated prompt.

| **[Teammates](https://agor.live/guide/teammates)**                        | Long-lived AI coworkers, each with its own Knowledge-base namespace for durable, semantically searchable memory — shared with the team and able to collaborate with other teammates.

| **[Security & RBAC](https://agor.live/guide/multiplayer-unix-isolation)** | Branch-scoped permission tiers, per-user credentials and env vars, and explicit execution modes (`simple` / `sandbox` / `delegated`).                                                                                                                                                |
| **[Knowledge](https://agor.live/guide/knowledge)**                        | A shared, searchable markdown knowledge base — one place for decisions, runbooks, prompts, and agent memory.                                                                                                                                                                         |

The **daemon** (`apps/agor-daemon`, FeathersJS) owns the database, services, WebSocket events, and
the MCP HTTP endpoint. The **executor** (`packages/executor`) is a process-isolated runtime that
spawns agents via their SDKs locally, inside the filesystem sandbox, or through a delegated external substrate. Shared types, the Drizzle schema,
and git utilities live in `@agor/core` (`packages/core`).

## Development

The fastest path to a running dev instance from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/preset-io/agor
cd agor
docker compose up
# Visit http://localhost:5173 → login: admin@agor.live / admin
```

Prefer running locally without Docker? The two-process workflow (daemon in watch mode + UI dev
server) and the `.agor.yml` variants (sqlite / postgres / rich / HA / docs) are documented in the
[Development Guide](https://agor.live/guide/development). It also covers running Agor _inside_ Agor
for dogfooding.

See **[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)** for the contribution workflow, and **[CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md)**
for the agent-oriented map of the codebase.
